### ESPOTIFAI

The framework used on this program it's the classical MVC+Network, and involves 
sockets, threads and data base usage. It needs a network configuring file and mp3
files to store, to make it run, you will need a JVM and a DB. See that this is a
team project, I'm the responsible and designer of package network and everything 
related with it in the models package, I highly contributed to the DataBase 
administration and the access to this one. I did not do anything on the views of 
the client and the server.


Espotifai it's a program made to share music between a server and all his clients.
In fact an user can list and download every song stored in the server, as well as
create play lists, play his songs and contribute to a common list named PartyList
which basically it's a play list shared by everyone.
This are some screen-shots of the program:
